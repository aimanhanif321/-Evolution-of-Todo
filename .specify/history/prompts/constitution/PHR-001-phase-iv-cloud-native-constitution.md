# Prompt History Record: Phase IV Cloud-Native Constitution

## Prompt Text

```text
I am currently working on:
Phase IV — Local Kubernetes Deployment using Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, Kagent, Docker Desktop, and Gordon (Docker AI Agent).

Your task is to write a professional "Phase IV Constitution" document that explains:

1) The vision and objective of Phase IV
2) How the system is transformed into a Cloud-Native AI platform
3) How Docker and Gordon are used for AI-assisted containerization
4) How Minikube is used as the local Kubernetes cluster
5) How Helm charts define the system as specs
6) How kubectl-ai and Kagent are used for AI-driven Kubernetes operations
7) How Spec-Driven Development applies to infrastructure
8) The cloud-native architecture of frontend, backend, MCP server, and database
9) The role of AI agents in DevOps and operations
10) Success criteria for Phase IV

Write it like a real technical constitution:
• Formal
• Clear
• Structured
• Professional
• Hackathon-ready
• Easy to understand

This document should make it obvious that this project is not a student app, but a real AI-operated cloud platform.
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive Phase IV Constitution document (v2.0.0) that transforms Taskora from a web application into a cloud-native AI-operated platform. The constitution includes:

**Structure:**
- Preamble establishing governance framework
- Part I: Foundational Principles (Identity, Vision, Philosophy)
- Part II: Technology Stack (Application + Cloud-Native)
- Part III: Cloud-Native Architecture (System diagram, Service definitions)
- Part IV: Containerization (Docker & Gordon governance)
- Part V: Kubernetes Orchestration (Minikube, Helm Charts, AI operations)
- Part VI: Spec-Driven Infrastructure
- Part VII: AI Agents in DevOps
- Part VIII: Governance (Success criteria, Amendment procedure)
- Appendices (Command reference, File structure)

**Key Additions:**
- Cloud-native stack definitions (Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, Kagent, Gordon)
- ASCII architecture diagram showing cluster layout
- AI agent hierarchy and governance
- Spec-driven infrastructure protocol
- 10 measurable success criteria
- Human oversight requirements matrix

## Artifacts Modified

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Updated | Major version bump 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0 |

## Lessons Learned

1. Constitution documents for cloud-native platforms should clearly separate application stack from infrastructure stack
2. AI agent governance requires explicit authority levels and human oversight requirements
3. Spec-driven development principles apply equally to infrastructure as to application code
4. Success criteria should be measurable via CLI commands

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend using Gordon
- [ ] Initialize Helm chart structure
- [ ] Configure Minikube cluster
- [ ] Install and configure kubectl-ai
- [ ] Deploy Kagent for autonomous operations
